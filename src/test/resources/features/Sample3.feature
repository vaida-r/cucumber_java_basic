  Scenario Outline: a new scenario outline
    Given I am on age page
    When I enter name: "<name>"
    And I enter age: <age>
    And I click submit age
    Then I see message: "<message>"

    Examples:
      | name  | age | message                        |

  Scenario Outline: a new scenario outline
    Given I am on age page
    When I enter feedback name: "<name>"
    And I enter feedback age: <age>
    Then click Send
    And I can see name "<name>" in feedback
    And I can see "<age>" in feedback
